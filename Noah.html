                <h2 class="story">Life Long Goal</h2>
        <p>My life long goal is to become a Pilot in the United States Air Force with a degree in Electrical Engineering.  I am able to do both because in the Air Force you need a Bachelor's degree to become an officer.  Only
        officers can become pilots in the Air Force.</p>
        <p>When I become an officer of the Air Force, I will be in charge of the ranks under me.  Once I have completed my Engineering degree I will then go into pilot training, which is my life-long goal.  
        Many people ask the question of why did you get and Engineering degree if you wanted to become a pilot.  You have to be and officer to be a pilot.  Engineering was just the degree I will choose to get.  </p>
        <p>My years of coding will help me in the classes I will have to take.  This class will give me  head start in my work for my Sys Opt Engr 311 at the Air force Academy.  </p>

             <h2 class="future">College</h2>
        <p>I hope to attend the Air Force Academy in Colorado in the Fall of 2019.  The Academy has a very good Engineering program and will prepare me to be an officer in the Air Force after I graduate.

        <p>
            As I endeavor to be apart of Work Based Learning I will gain experience with coding.  Not only with code, but also with establishing contacts within the community.  These contactswill help me with my coding process.
            It will also give me a good experience with new people and work.

        </p>
        <p>
            I will meet the course standards based on my work ethic.  I will be able to meet with my contact to talk about the Website or app I will create for them.  I will be able to meet the course standards because of the time 
            and content of the website or app.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will gain work based skills inside the class room while working with my contact outside of the classroom.  I will use my knowledge of code to assist me in this endeavor.  I will create create a website or app that my 
            contact can use.  Social media will help me to promote the website or app.  With the rise of new technology I will be able to create a website or app that will look fresh and new.  This website will have the greatest 
            code, transitions, and formats. 
        </p>
        <p>These things along with my major will help propell me in life.  This will be a great experience working with new people.  I am excited for the challenge of this project and my future.</p>
