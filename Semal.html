        <h1 class="sh1">My Life</h1>
        <p class="sp">My plans after high school are to attend Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ and have a major in Computer Science and minor in Cybersecurity. Artificial Intelligence has made me very curious since I first saw it on the Terminator and
            I would like to pursue the research of that in my career.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sp">Something that Madison and Stevens have in common is the emphasis on work based learning. Work based learning is at the core of all experience. Only after working on something that has real world application can you definitively say that you have
            true experience. Coding Practicum is the final technology class at Madison you can take. Work based learning has been at the core of Coding I, Coding II, and Coding III. The websites we made in Coding I and Coding II are examples of websites
            that companies would pay for to be made. The group work that we've done in the past coding classes help improve group work efficiency and demonstrate to each person in the group what they are good at. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="sp">Stevens has an excellent staff and a free tutor program to help me meet the course's standards.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sp">The classes at Stevens are focused on real world application, not just the concept. So, after graduation the job requirments will not be foreign.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sp">The co-op program at Stevens helps you get hired at a real company and you get paid to work on a project with other team members. This experience can give you connections making it easier to get the job you want right out of college. When I went
            to tour Stevens, I asked someone in the co-op program wheather it makes to get a job and she told me that even though she hasnâ€™t started senior year yet she already has a job for when she graduates. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="sp">Keeping up with the times is something any higher learning institution has to think about, especially with technology. Now, you have to know more to be a successful software engineer than you did 10 years ago. If you want to be a software engineer,
            you need software and coding classes but if that is all you focus on you will not be the best software engineer. To be the best you have to have a rounded learning experience. That means you will know about coding and software but you will
            also learn how to make your software secure and easy to update. Companies now mostly give jobs to people who know the most about the entire process. As an example, full stack web developers are in higher demand because they know the front
            end and the back end of the website. They are also harder to fire because if you fire one full stack developer you lose the front end and back end support for the website. The more you know the more valuable you are. </p>
